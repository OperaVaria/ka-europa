# K치-Eur칩pa podcast website

Website for the "K치-Eur칩pa" podcast. The frontend is a fairly regular, custom made,
HTML-CSS-JS website, with a responsive, flexbox design. Basic accessibility
features are implemented. The backend uses the Flask framework and its
extensions (Talisman, Minify) for added functionality.

Currently accessible **[here](https://www.ka-europa.com/)**.
